# Things that I still need to do

* finish the summary email templates
* Make basic landing page that explains the premise and has CTA.
* Implement a monetization scheme, Pay a small amount per month to have extra things. maybe $1 a thing.
* task/email sent out at end of period showing progress, goals for next period.

# Ideas

* hook up to 3rd party APIs that can be used to log incidents. (weigh yourself today, walk more than 2 miles, go for a bike ride.) things that area easily tied into from existing apps.

* Pivot around social theme? Users can sign up for similar Things and join in conversation around those things.
